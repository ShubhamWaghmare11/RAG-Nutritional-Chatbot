Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

The glands secrete hormones, which are biological molecules that regulate cellular processes in other target tissues, so they require transportation by the circulatory system. Adequate nutrition is critical for the functioning of all the glands in the endocrine system. A protein deficiency impairs gonadal-hormone release, preventing reproduction. Athletic teenage girls with very little body fat often do not menstruate. Children who are malnourished usually do not produce enough growth hormone and fail to reach normal height for their age group. Probably the most popularized connection between nutrition and the functions of the endocrine system is that unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to obesity and the development of Type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that twenty-six million Americans have Type 2 diabetes as of 2011. This is 8.3 percent of the US population. Counties with the highest incidence of obesity also have the highest incidence of Type 2 diabetes.',\n",

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile.

            "* Water-Soluble Vitamins UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM All water-soluble vitamins play a different kind of role in energy metabolism; they are required as functional parts of enzymes involved in energy release and storage. Vitamins and minerals that make up part of enzymes are referred to as coenzymes and cofactors, respectively. Coenzymes and cofactors are required by enzymes to catalyze a specific reaction. They assist in converting a substrate to an end-product. Coenzymes and cofactors are essential in catabolic pathways and play a role in many anabolic pathways too. In addition to being essential for metabolism, many vitamins and minerals are required for blood renewal and function. At insufficient levels in the diet these vitamins and minerals impair the health of blood and consequently the delivery of nutrients in and wastes out, amongst its many other functions. In this section we will focus on the vitamins that take part in metabolism and blood function and renewal. Figure 9.7 Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors 550 | Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",
            "* Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 One major difference between fat-soluble vitamins and water- soluble vitamins is the way they are absorbed in the body. Vitamins are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic system to the liver. Water-soluble vitamins on the other hand are absorbed in the small intestine but are transported to the liver through blood vessels.

            "* Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 To combat this issue the Island Food Community of Pohnpei has been instrumental in promoting the citizens of Pohnpei to increase local karat banana consumption. The karat banana is rich in beta- carotene (a source of vitamin A) and increasing consumption among the locals will decrease the prevalence of vitamin A deficiencies in Pohnpei. For further information on this issue visit the Island Food Community of Pohnpei’s website at http://www.islandfood.org/ and watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=DGVxnefqbTQ. Vitamins are organic compounds that are traditionally assigned to two groups fat-soluble (hydrophobic) or water-soluble (hydrophilic). This classification determines where they act in the body. Water-soluble vitamins act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such as blood; fat-soluble vitamins are largely responsible for protecting cell membranes from free radical damage. The body can synthesize some vitamins, but others must be obtained from the diet. Figure 9.1 The Vitamins https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14984164. Accessed October 15, 2017. Introduction | 517\n",
            "* Accessed October 28, 2017. Choline Choline is a water-soluble substance that is not classified as a vitamin because it can be synthesized by the body. However, the synthesis of choline is limited and therefore it is recognized as an essential nutrient. Choline is need to perform functions such as the synthesis of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the synthesis of phospholipids used to make cell membranes, lipid transport, and also homocysteine metabolism. A deficiency in choline may lead to interfered brain development in the fetus during pregnancy, and in adults cause fatty liver and muscle damage. 586 | Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",

The salivary glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles. Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not function in the acidic conditions of the stomach. \",\n",
